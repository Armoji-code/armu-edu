# Armu · v0.3

A free, open source, self-hosted school platform. Replaces fragmented school software (diary systems, Google Classroom, messaging, grades, library) with a single unified platform that schools own and run themselves.

Licensed under **AGPL-3.0** — free to use, modify, and self-host. Distributions and hosted services must release source code.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python · Flask · Flask-SocketIO · Flask-Migrate · SQLAlchemy |
| Database | SQLite (small deployments) / PostgreSQL (larger) |
| AI | Pluggable — Ollama (local, no API costs), OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS SPA (no framework) · single-shell router · partial HTML pages |
| Real-time | WebSockets via Flask-SocketIO (chat, whiteboard, meetings, notifications) |
| Scheduling | APScheduler (deadline reminders, weekly digests) |

---

## Getting started

The quickest way to get running is the interactive setup script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Armoji-code/armu-edu
cd armu-edu
bash setup.sh
```

It installs dependencies, generates a secret key, walks you through AI provider selection (including pulling Ollama models), initialises the database, and optionally creates demo accounts.

Then start the server:

```bash
cd backend && python app.py
```

The app starts at **http://localhost:5000**.

### Manual setup

```bash
# 1. Create venv and install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — at minimum set SECRET_KEY:
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# 3. Initialise the database
cd backend && flask --app app db upgrade

# 5. Run
python app.py
```

## AI setup

By default Armu uses **Ollama** for local inference (no API costs, runs on your server).

```bash
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.com
ollama pull gemma3:12b      # tutor + advanced model
ollama pull llama3.2:3b     # tracker model (digests, nudges, auto-title)
```

To switch to OpenAI or Anthropic, go to **Admin → Settings → AI Configuration** after logging in — no restart required. All AI settings are stored per-school in the database and take effect immediately.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `backend/.env`. Key variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | *(insecure default)* | **Required** — set a random secret before deploying |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite at repo root | PostgreSQL URL for production |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` for local development only |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:5000` | Allowed CORS / WebSocket origins |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | `ollama` | `ollama` \| `openai` \| `anthropic` |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server URL |

All AI settings can also be changed at runtime via Admin → Settings.

## Security

### Data at rest

The SQLite database is **not encrypted by default**. Anyone who obtains the file can read its contents. Passwords are bcrypt-hashed, but everything else (names, emails, grades, messages) is plaintext.

The simplest protection for a self-hosted deployment is **full-disk encryption** on the server machine — the OS encrypts everything on the drive, so a stolen disk or file is unreadable without the login credentials.

| OS | Built-in tool | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | LUKS (via `cryptsetup`) | [Arch Wiki — dm-crypt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system) |
| Windows | BitLocker | [Microsoft Docs — BitLocker](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c7b0e5c-9b8e-d5dc-f9ef-1aa6e1f4) |
| macOS | FileVault | [Apple Support — FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102665) |

For additional protection, also:
- Restrict the database file to the server user: `chmod 600 armu.db`
- Keep the server on a LAN and off the public internet
- Back up the database to an encrypted location

## Changelog

### v0.3
- **In-call whiteboard** — whiteboard icon in the call topbar opens the full collaborative whiteboard in a left-side tab panel (replaces video grid while open); tab bar design makes it straightforward to add more in-call tools later
- **Participants toggle** — dedicated button in the call topbar hides/shows the participants sidebar
- **Assignment creation fixed** — the "New Assignment" modal was missing from the HTML; restored with all fields (title, description, subject, type, due date)
- **Page layout fixed** — a settings-specific CSS rule (`max-width: 680px` on `.content`) was cascading globally, squishing every page; removed
- **Page revisit fixed** — navigating away and back to a page caused infinite loading because `const`/`let` re-declarations threw `SyntaxError`; the router now rewrites them to `var` before injection so scripts are safely re-runnable
- **onclick handlers fixed** — an earlier IIFE-wrapping approach scoped all partial functions locally, breaking every button across the app; reverted in favour of the `const`→`var` approach which keeps functions in global scope

### v0.2
- Real-time collaborative whiteboard (canvas, shapes, text tool, eraser)
- WebRTC video meetings (camera, mic, screen share, multi-peer)
- Direct messaging between users
- Group study rooms with shared AI chat sessions
- Teacher assignment management and grade sheet
- Admin performance monitoring dashboard
- Notification system with real-time SocketIO delivery

### v0.1
- Initial release: student dashboard, AI tutor, homework/tests, schedule, grades, calendar, leaderboard, library, activities, conduct log
- Multi-role auth (student / teacher / admin / librarian)
- Multi-provider AI (Ollama / OpenAI / Anthropic)
- APScheduler deadline reminders and weekly AI digest
